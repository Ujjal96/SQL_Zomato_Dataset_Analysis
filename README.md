# Zomato_Dataset_Analysis
Zomato is a big company that helps people find restaurants and get food delivered. The dataset they have has lots of information about restaurants, like their names, where they are, what food they serve, and more.

In my analysis with SQL (a way to work with data), I did these things:

1. Checked the table details, like what each column is called and what type of information it holds.
2. Looked for any restaurants that were listed more than once and fixed that.
3. Got rid of any information we didn't need.
4. Combined two different sets of data and added a new column to show which country each restaurant is in.
5. Fixed any city names that were spelled wrong.
6. Counted how many restaurants there are using a special method.
7. Checked the smallest, biggest, and average values for things like votes (how many people rated the restaurant), ratings, and currency used.
8. Made a new category to group restaurants based on their ratings.

From looking at the data, I found out:

1. Most of the data is about restaurants in India, with a smaller amount from the USA.
2. Only a few countries offer online delivery options, like 28.01% of restaurants in India and 46.67% in the UAE.
3. Since there's a lot of info about Indian restaurants, I focused on them.
4. Connaught Place in New Delhi has the most restaurants listed, followed by Rajouri Garden and Shahdara.
5. North Indian food is really popular in Connaught Place.
6. Not all restaurants in Connaught Place let you book tables, but most do.
7. Restaurants that let you book tables tend to have higher ratings than those that don't.
8. I found a great moderately priced Indian restaurant in Kolkata called 'India Restaurant' that offers table booking, online delivery, and has high ratings and votes.

Overall, this analysis helped us understand how restaurants are doing in different places and what customers like.
